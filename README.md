# Kitchen Chemistry for Kids of All Ages

Most of the time when people think about chemistry, they don't think about the Kitchen. Beside the fact that cooking is chemistry, there are a lot of different experiments which are non-toxic and safe! From hot snow and super saturated solutions, to chameleon cabbage and disappearing dyes, we will present experiments which kids and parents can do together for Science! Kitchen Chemistryâ€¦ it's not just volcanos anymore.

This repository contains a presentation and book, first given at Kidzmash 2.0.18 in Sandusky, OH on 10 January 2018.
